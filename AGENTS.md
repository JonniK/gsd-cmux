# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) working on this repository.

## Repository shape

This repo is a **thin adapter** between GSD and OMC — it is not an orchestrator, framework, or replacement for either tool. The only runtime artifacts are:

- `setup-gsd-omc.sh` — idempotent installer
- `skills/gsd-omc-bridge/SKILL.md` — worker lifecycle contract (loaded via GSD `agent_skills`)
- `commands/gsd-omc-run.md` — full-lifecycle entry point (`/gsd-omc-run`)
- `commands/gsd-omc-execute.md` — single-phase wave orchestrator (`/gsd-omc-execute`)
- `commands/gsd-omc-verify.md` — end-to-end smoke test (`/gsd-omc-verify`)

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for architecture.

## Invariants — do not break these

1. **Target is the thin adapter.** If OMC or GSD already provides something (panes, team API, worker lifecycle, phase-plan graph, Task subagents), the adapter uses it — never re-implements it. "Copy-pasting OMC logic into our commands" is a smell.

2. **`agent_skills` schema.** GSD's `init.cjs` validates `agent_skills` as an **object keyed by agent-type** (e.g. `gsd-executor`), values are arrays of `global:<name>` references. Absolute paths are silently dropped by `validatePath`. There is **no** `phase_skills` key. This invariant survives because it is GSD's contract, not ours.

3. **Literal substitution.** Task subagents and spawned CLI workers run in separate process trees with no env inheritance from the orchestrator's Bash tool calls. When a slash command template references a dynamic value (phase name, team name, worker name), substitute it as a **literal string** at prompt-build time — never assume `$VAR` is visible. (Memory: `feedback_task_subagents_need_literal_substitution`.)

4. **Read the consumer, not the template.** Before writing or merging config shapes (especially `.planning/config.json`), grep GSD's parser (`~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/lib/init.cjs`) to confirm the shape it actually accepts. Template files can drift. (Memory: `feedback_read_consumer_before_writing_config`.)

5. **Registry probe, never execute.** To check that a package is installed, use `npm view` / `npm list -g` / `--version`. Never "run the tool to see if it exists" — side effects, hangs, background processes. (Memory: `feedback_registry_probe_not_execute`.)

6. **Idempotency infra in v1.** Every file write in `setup-gsd-omc.sh` goes through `write_file` — 3-branch helper (new / unchanged / differs-with-backup). Must be correct on the first rerun, not patched after. (Memory: `feedback_idempotency_infra_before_rerun`.)

7. **`using-X` skill is canonical.** For cmux specifics, read `~/.claude/skills/using-cmux/skills/using-cmux/SKILL.md` before writing `cmux send*` / `new-split` / `send-key` logic. Template files drift; the skill is authoritative. (Memory: `feedback_using_skill_is_canonical_source`.)

8. **OMC team API — real signatures, not guesses.** Verify `omc team api <op> --help` before writing the call. Known traps:
   - `claim-task` returns `.data.claimToken` (camelCase); every `transition-task-status` requires it under `claim_token` (snake_case) in the input.
   - Task states are `pending | blocked | in_progress | completed | failed`. Workers poll for `pending`, not `open`.
   - `create-task` with `owner` pre-assigns to a worker; workers self-identify via `$OMC_TEAM_WORKER` = `<team>/<worker-name>`.
   - Every `omc team api <op> --json` wraps the payload as `{ok, operation, data: {...}}` — jq paths go through `.data.*`. Task id field is `.id`.

8a. **`omc team` without `--new-window` for cmux visibility.** OMC's `createTeamSession` (cli.cjs ~27453) only creates a dedicated tmux window when `--new-window` is set. Without the flag, it splits the current tmux pane — and since cmux is a tmux wrapper, those splits surface as native cmux panes. Passing `--new-window` from inside cmux produces invisible workers.

9. **Never touch `$CLAUDE/hooks/` or `$CLAUDE/settings.json` hooks.** OMC owns its lifecycle hooks; GSD owns its own. This adapter is **slash commands + one skill**, nothing else. `omc doctor conflicts` must stay clean after install.

10. **`/gsd-omc-run` wraps, not intercepts.** Reroutes only the `execute-phase` stage through OMC. Planner / verifier / researcher subagents stay inline. Full Task interception is Z-mode — see DESIGN §15. Do not attempt Z-mode in ordinary patches.

## Verification gate

Any change to `commands/*.md` or `skills/gsd-omc-bridge/SKILL.md` must pass `/gsd-omc-verify` before being considered done. The scaffolded `_verify-phase` exercises: spawn → create-task with `owner` → claim → SUMMARY.md → transition → teardown.

For `--full`, add `/gsd-omc-run phase _verify-phase` to exercise the wrapper.

## Before committing

1. Rerun `/gsd-omc-verify` — assertions pass.
2. Self-audit against the memory lessons referenced in the invariants above.
3. Keep commit atomic — never mix adapter code with unrelated repo changes.
